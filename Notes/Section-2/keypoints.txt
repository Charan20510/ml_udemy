Summary
Understanding the importance of splitting data into training and test sets for machine learning model evaluation.

Highlights
⚖️ Splitting data into training and test sets is crucial for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.
📊 Training set is used to build the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.
🚗 Example scenario: predicting car sale prices using mileage and age as independent variables.
📈 Model predictions are compared to actual prices from the test set to assess model accuracy.
🧐 Evaluation helps determine if the model needs improvement.
🤖 Importance of data preprocessing in ensuring model accuracy and reliability.

Summary
Feature scaling in machine learning involves adjusting values in columns to make them comparable. Normalization and standardization are two main techniques used for feature scaling.

Highlights
💡 Feature scaling is always applied to columns, not across rows.
📊 Normalization involves adjusting values in a column to be between 0 and 1.
📈 Standardization adjusts values in a column to be between -3 and 3.
🧮 Scaling helps avoid errors in comparisons when values have different units.
🔄 Normalization example with income and age columns shows the importance of feature scaling.
📉 Normalized values show that the purple person is evenly between the red and blue people.
🤖 Feature scaling is crucial for accurate machine learning algorithms.
