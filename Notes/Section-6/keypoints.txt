#   So on the left, we have our dependent variable, which we're trying to predict. On the right, we have our independent variable, which is the predictor. Here we have b0, which is the y-intercept, also known as the constant, and b1 is the slope coefficient.

#   How do we know which of the sloped lines is the best one? Is it this one or is it this one? As we can see, there can be multiple slope lines that we can draw through our data points. And how do we know which one is the best one, which is the best linear regression, and, in fact, how do we even define the best one?

#   The Ordinary Least Squares method. And the way it works in a visual sense is we need to take our data points and project them vertically onto our linear regression line. Now, we would need to do this for every single linear regression line that we're considering, but for simplicity's sake in this tutorial, we're just going to do it with this line here in the middle.

#   Now, for each pair of points, we have two values, yi and yi-hat. So, what are these values? yi is the actual amount of potatoes. In our case, in our example, potatoes yielded from the farm when that specific amount of nitrogen fertilizer was used. So, let's say 15 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer were used and the farm yielded two tons of potatoes.

#   yi-hat, on the other hand, is what this linear regression that we're considering, Let's have a look at simple linear regression. and we will look at the parts of this equation one by one.

#   But what we want to do is we want to find the best line, and it will be related to how small these differences are, as we can imagine.

#   There's our yi and yi-hat. The difference between them is called the residual. Here's our equation. And the best equation is such equation where b, or where such an equation where the parameters b0 and b1 are such that the sum of the squares of the residuals is minimized. And that's why it's called the Ordinary Least Squares method.

#   So, we need to take all of these residuals, these differences, we need to square them for every single data point, and then we need to add up the sum. And whenever we find the smallest value, so, for whichever regression line this value is going to be the smallest, that will be the best regression line.

#   And that will guarantee that the line is going nicely through the data points and it is the best line or the best linear regression to use for modeling our problem.

#   Regression This is the branch of machine learning that aims to predict some continuous real numbers, like for example, a salary, or a temperature, or any kind of continuous numerical value.

#   It is a dataset containing, as you can see 30 observations, and two columns with of course, one feature. This is the feature, years of experience, and the dependent variable, which we want to predict, which is the salary.

#   And so, the goal, very simply, is to build a simple linear regression model, that will be trained to understand the correlations between the number of years of experience and the salary, so that it can predict for a new employee, you know, having a new number of years of experience, well, the corresponding salary, or the salary that this person should get.

Summary
In this tutorial, we will be focusing on mastering simple linear regression and its implementation using Python.

Highlights
💡 Regression models aim to predict continuous real numbers, such as salary or temperature.
💡 Starting with simple linear regression, which involves one independent variable and one continuous real value to predict.
💡 Other regression models include multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.
💡 The goal is to have a toolkit of regression models to choose from when predicting outcomes for different datasets.
💡 The dataset for simple linear regression contains 30 observations with years of experience as the feature and salary as the dependent variable.
💡 Code templates provided can be easily adapted to new datasets by changing only a few variables.
💡 Focus is on building a strong understanding of the model itself through the use of a simple dataset.
